# onedark-wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers colourised to fit the onedark gtk theme (some curated by myself)

The wallpapers featured here have been found from a variety of sources including [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/), the [r/unixporn discord wallpapers channel](https://discord.gg/unixporn), this amazing [gruvbox collelction](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.onrender.com/), (the now deceased)[ catppuccin wallpaper repo](https://web.archive.org/web/20230215022523/https://github.com/catppuccin/wallpapers) (wayback machine link should work) and the fabulous [nordic-wallpapers repo](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers). A bunch of these wallpapers also came from various image dumps on imgur and have have been put through the onedark filter of [ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it/).
The images here are of at least 1920x1080 and above (some as large as 5K)

I plan on adding to this as time goes on as I belive this is the only active onedark wallpaper repo existing thus far (I have found [this older repo](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanNile/onedark-wallpapers)).

### If there are any wallpapers that their respectful creators which to be removed, please make an issue and I will remove them ASAP.

## Colour reference

I am using the colour reference from [joshdick's onedark.vim repo](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) as I believe their colours represent onedark the best:

Not all of the colours are 100% accurate as some of the ImageGoNorded images contain colours which aren't in the onedark colourscheme, however they would look much worse if it were so. With a fully riced setup you shouldn't notice it too much. 

Update: Due to the lack of darker tones for more complex wallpapers I modify by hand, I am using the [Atom One Dark 2 Color Palette grey colours](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1017620). I think these greys are the most faithful to onedark so I will use them. If you know of any others that will do the job better please let me know.

Update 2: Also using #c8ccd4 for even lighter colours than #abb2bf

Heres an example of onedark being applied to a non onedark image (using ImageGoNord):

psa: if you have any wallpapers (that have been onedarked accordingly and look pretty cool) and want to be a contributor please let me know!
