# OneDark Wallpapers

A curated collection of wallpapers colorized to match the OneDark GTK theme. Some were created by me, while others were sourced from various platforms.

## Color Reference
I'm using the color palette from [joshdick's onedark.vim repo](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) as I believe it best represents OneDark:

Note that not all colors are 100% accurate, as some ImageGoNord-processed images contain colors outside the OneDark scheme. With a fully customized setup, this shouldn't be too noticeable.

For darker tones in complex wallpapers that I modify manually, I use the [Atom One Dark 2 Color Palette grey colors](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1017620). These greys feel most faithful to OneDark:

- For even lighter colors than #abb2bf, I use #c8ccd4.

Here's an example of OneDark applied to a non-OneDark image (processed with ImageGoNord):
