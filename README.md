# OneDark Wallpapers

A collection of wallpapers colorised to fit the OneDark GTK theme, curated by myself and sourced from various platforms.

See the wallpaper showcase [here](./showcase.md).

## Sources

The wallpapers featured here have been sourced from:

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/)
- [r/unixporn Discord wallpapers channel](https://discord.gg/unixporn)
- This amazing [Gruvbox collection](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.onrender.com/)
- The now-deceased [Catppuccin wallpaper repo](https://web.archive.org/web/20230215022523/https://github.com/catppuccin/wallpapers) (Wayback Machine link)
- The fabulous [Nordic wallpapers repo](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers)

Many wallpapers also come from various image dumps on Imgur and have been processed through the OneDark filter of [ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it/). The images here are at least 1920x1080 and above (some as large as 5K).

I plan on adding more wallpapers over time, as I believe this is the only active OneDark wallpaper repository. (I have found [this older repo](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanNile/onedark-wallpapers).)

### Removal Requests

If there are any wallpapers that their rightful creators wish to be removed, please make an issue and I will remove them ASAP.

## Color Reference

I am using the color reference from [joshdick's onedark.vim repo](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) as I believe their colors represent OneDark the best:

Not all of the colors are 100% accurate, as some of the ImageGoNord-processed images contain colors not in the OneDark color scheme. However, with a fully customised setup, you shouldn't notice it too much. 

### Updates

- Due to the lack of darker tones for more complex wallpapers I modify by hand, I am using the [Atom One Dark 2 Color Palette grey colors](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1017620). I think these greys are the most faithful to OneDark, so I will use them. If you know of any others that will do the job better, please let me know.

- Additionally, I am using `#c8ccd4` for even lighter colors than `#abb2bf`.

Here's an example of OneDark being applied to a non-OneDark image (using ImageGoNord):
