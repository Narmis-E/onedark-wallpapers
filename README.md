# OneDark Wallpapers

A curated collection of wallpapers colorized to match the OneDark GTK theme. \
Some created by me ðŸ¤—, others sourced from various platforms.

## Color Reference
I'm using the color palette from [joshdick's onedark.vim repo](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) as I believe it best represents OneDark:

![OneDark Grey Reference](https://github.com/Narmis-E/onedark-wallpapers/blob/main/onedark_grey_ref.png)
For darker tones I use [Atom One Dark 2 grey colors](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1017620). These greys feel most faithful to OneDark ^

Here's an example of OneDark applied to a non-OneDark image (processed with ImageGoNord):
![Before and After](https://github.com/Narmis-E/onedark-wallpapers/blob/main/before-after.png)
It retains a lot of detail, while subtly shifting the coloursheme.
For more minimal images with less colour, the change is much more apparent:

In this ^ case, IGN was a bit off the mark, so I'd probably touch it up by making the bg blue.
